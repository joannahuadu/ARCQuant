**ARCQuant** is a high-performance quantization framework designed to resolve the conflict between accuracy and inference efficiency in low-bit LLMs.

While fine-grained quantization (e.g., Block-wise/NVFP4) effectively isolates quantization noise, activation outliers still degrade performance in critical channels. Traditional mixed-precision methods address this by splitting computations into separate branches, which introduces significant kernel launch overhead and memory fragmentation.

ARCQuant takes a different approach. Instead of treating outliers separately, we leverage the structural sparsity of quantization errors in fine-grained settings. We capture the quantization residuals of these critical channels and fuse them back into the computation as **Augmented Residual Channels (ARC)**.

To do: 

- [x] Release arxiv version of [ARCQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07475).
- [x] Release code for reproducing results.
- [x] Release CUDA kernels on NVFP4.
- [x] Release calibration and preprocessing scripts.
- [x] Support [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) integration.
- [ ] **Model Support**: Add support for more model families:
    - [ ] Qwen3
    - [ ] Mixtral
    - [ ] Wan2.2


## 1. Installation
```bash
conda create -n arcquant python=3.10 -y
conda activate arcquant
```
Please make sure that [CUDA 12.8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-8-1-download-archive?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=22.04&target_type=runfile_local) is in your environment.
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/actypedef/ARCQuant.git
cd ARCQuant
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Building Kernels
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
```
```bash
conda install pybind11
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```
```bash
cd kernels/
bash remake.sh
```

This might take a few minutes.

### 2.2 Preprocessing

Reorder_indices, select_num are needed for quantization:
```bash
python reorder_indices.py --model /PATH/TO/YOUR/MODEL/ --samples 128 --seqlen 2048 --act_sort_metric max
```
Results are saved in ./saved/

### 2.3 Accuracy Evaluation
```bash
bash evaluate.sh /PATH/TO/YOUR/MODEL/
```

## 3. Efficiency Evaluation

FlashInfer:
```bash
cd third-party/flashinfer
python -m pip install -v .
```
We will release our vLLM evaluation very soon.
